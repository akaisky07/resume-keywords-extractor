# resume-keywords-extractor
The flask app extracts resume keywords.

I have used docker to create the package. Dependencies will be automatically downloaded upon running the docker file.

Steps to follow:
1: Download the github repo
2: Move to file directory and open the the terminal
3: Use command docker build -t my-flask-app . to build docker image.
4: Use command docker build -t my-flask-app . to run the image.
5: go to port and check out the web app.
